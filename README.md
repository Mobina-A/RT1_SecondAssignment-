# RT1_SecondAssignment
The second assignment of research track 1 course is about the use of a robot simulator in ROS. 

The tasks for this assignment are to move the robot in the environment to the goal position that chosen by user.
In this assignment we are using operator ROS custom messages, costum services, and actions.It is also required to create a launch file to start the simulation.

The main part of the assignment involves creating three nodes, which I have named node_a, node_b, and node_c. To set up the server and send the message, we need to create 'srv' and 'msg' files. Additionally, we have to modify the CMakeLists.txt and launch file ('assignment1.launch').
